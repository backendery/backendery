# Backendery Digital Studio

## Company Overview

Backendery is a digital engineering studio focused on building reliable,
high-performance software systems. We specialize in backend development,
reactive web interfaces, AI-powered solutions, and complex business automation.

Our team works closely with clients to understand business goals and translate
them into scalable, maintainable, and production-ready systems.

We primarily work with startups, product teams, and businesses that require
custom engineering rather than off-the-shelf solutions.

Team experience averages 10+ years per engineer.

## Case Studies

### Trading System (Sports & Odds)

An internal fully automated trading system integrated with the Betfair exchange.
The platform includes custom mathematical models, real-time event analysis,
probability distribution, risk assessment, and automated decision-making.

The system processes live data streams and executes trades autonomously,
with real-time notifications for monitoring and control.

**Technologies:**  
Python, Rust, FastAPI, Axum, SciPy, SQLAlchemy, Diesel, Rayon, SerDe, PostgreSQL

**Outcome:**  
Enabled low-latency automated trading with real-time risk control and
high operational reliability.

---

### Event Watcher (Monitoring & Analytics)

A system for defining and executing complex logic-based formulas derived from
real-time metrics. Users can build custom conditions that trigger actions such as
alerts and notifications based on continuous evaluation over time windows.

Designed for high observability and fault tolerance.

**Technologies:**  
Python, Aiohttp, Asyncio, AST, APScheduler, Pandas, Pydantic, InfluxDB, Sentry, MongoDB

**Outcome:**  
Provided real-time monitoring with automated alerts, reducing response time
to critical events.

---

### Online Store (E-commerce)

A high-performance backend for an online store selling metal and steel products.
The system includes a flexible product configurator allowing customers to modify
product parameters such as size and material with real-time price recalculation.

The solution streamlined order processing and improved customer engagement.

**Technologies:**  
Python, FastAPI, Ariadne (GraphQL), NGINX, Redis, Pydantic, Peewee, PostgreSQL,
Alembic, Datadog

**Outcome:**  
Improved order management efficiency and enabled real-time product customization
at scale.

## Services

### High-Performance Backend Development

We build mission-critical backend systems using Rust and Python.
Our focus is on low-latency APIs, distributed systems, and architectures where
performance, reliability, and memory safety are essential.

**Key areas:**
- High-load APIs
- Distributed systems
- Cloud-native scalability
- Data-intensive services

---

### AI Agents & LLM Operations

We design and implement autonomous AI agents that go beyond simple API wrappers.
Our solutions use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), tool usage, and
multi-agent orchestration to automate complex reasoning and decision-making tasks.

**Key areas:**
- Custom RAG and vector search
- Agent workflows and tool integration
- LLM integration and fine-tuning

---

### Intelligence-Driven User Interfaces

We develop modern interfaces where AI is a core feature rather than an add-on.
This includes intelligent chatbots, interactive dashboards, and reactive web
applications powered by real-time data and AI reasoning.

**Key areas:**
- React.js and Next.js ecosystems
- Real-time reactive UI
- AI-powered user interactions

---

### Complex Automation

We connect legacy systems with modern infrastructure and AI capabilities.
Our team builds advanced automation pipelines that eliminate manual processes
and operational bottlenecks.

**Key areas:**
- Workflow orchestration
- Data pipeline automation
- Legacy-to-cloud integration
